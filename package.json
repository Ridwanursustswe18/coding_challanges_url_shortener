  "description": "- It is web application that shortens long urls. # how to run the project - First install node.js and express.js. - Then setup a firebase database to store the urls. - Setup Nginx to use reverse proxy. click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Cy_NqNuf83Uvbkxg93hJIyJmHhnU0cSPjrZld45jtE/edit?usp=sharing) to setup the proxy server. # what it does - it takes long urls and generate key and attach it with short url and store long-url,short-url and key in database. - key is genrated by hashing the long url with 'sha-256' algorithm and encode in 'base64'. I also handled if a same key is genrated and i maintaned a hash-set to go through if a same key exists. If it exists then it is re-hashed again. - After that short-url given will re-direct to the actual website. - Stored url can also be deleted. - errors are also handled for all cases. # technologies used - Javascript, node.js, express.js, firebase, nginx.",
